# Regular Expression Exerciser

This project is a simple regular expression exerciser powered by [React.js](https://reactjs.org/+), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/).

## Motivation

I was working for couple of years with Vue.js and Quasar Framework away from React.js so I needed to refresh my knowledge about React.
The first step to achieve my goal was to develop this simple web app.
Also, I learned some about Gatsby and Grommet.
